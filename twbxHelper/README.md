A .twbx file is a Tableau Workbook.

This application is a Lambda function that helps distribute Tableau workbooks
to customers. 

There are two parts:
* Upload the .twbx and .png "teaser" for a customer. This is intended to bed performed by an Amplio staffer.
* Serve the .twbx and .png file. The .png will be shown on a web page, and the .twbx will be behind a download button or link on the page.
